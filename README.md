This is a short explanation for using this game.

I've just realized I've not made a tuto in order to learn to use is, so, shortly, here it is:

There are two players who each have 6 keys to use in the game (it should be used in AZERTY mode):

Player 1 :
    - direction : Z, Q, S, D
    - attack / capacity : A, E
Player 2 :
    - direction : 4, 5, 6, 8 (keypad)
    - attack / capacity : 7, 9 (keypad)

At the beginning, you must choose a role with special attack and capacity by using left and right, and down to take the
selected role. Here is a description of the roles in the order:

Warrior:
- attacks with his sword
- puts down blocks that make projectiles bounce on them

Archer:
- fires arrows with his bow
- puts down a special block that shoots arrows when the player shoots one too

Mage:
- launches a fireball
- launches a big fireball that inflicts a lot of damage and makes the mage regenerate his life

Monk:
- hits the player with his scepter
- summons two ghosts if he's over a grave (that appears when a player dies on a non functional block)


In order to interact with the stuff around you, you can use the DOWN key (S for player 1 for example)
You can interact with all of those items :
- bush -> allows to hide and to get more health if the bush has berries (a bush with a lot of berries can be found in
the upper world and allows to get some extra life)
- stump -> allows to teleport to another stump
- upgrading rocks (rocks with a gem inside them) -> allows to deal more damage
- UFO (ship) -> allows to move more rapidly and to fly to reach the world at the top of the map


So here it is, I hope you'll play my game and will love it, and even if it's not as cool as it's supposed to for it to
be published on Poki, I still hope it's cool
